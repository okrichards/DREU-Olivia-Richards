## DREU Summer 2018 at the University of Washington 

Olivia Richards was matched with Dr. Julie Kientz at the University of Washington, in the department of Human Centered Design and Engineering. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
